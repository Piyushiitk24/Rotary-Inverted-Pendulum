# Rotary Inverted Pendulum - Development Log

## November 4, 2025

### Hardware Setup Completed
- **Arduino**: Mega 2560 (ATmega2560)
- **Motor Driver**: TMC2209 (Step/Direction interface)
- **Stepper Motor**: 200 steps/revolution (1.8° per step)
- **Sensors**: 2x AS5600 magnetic encoders
  - Pendulum sensor on Hardware I2C (pins 20/21)
  - Motor sensor on Software I2C (pins 22/24)

### Motor Configuration
- **Control Pins**: Step=5, Dir=6, Enable=7
- **Motor Settings**: 
  - Speed: 1000 steps/sec
  - Acceleration: 2000 steps/sec²
- **Direction Mapping**: 
  - CCW (counter-clockwise) = positive steps = "right"
  - CW (clockwise) = negative steps = "left"

### Sensor Characterization
- **Both sensors**: Decreasing angle with CW rotation, increasing with CCW
- **Pendulum Sensor**: Mounted on Hardware I2C, magnet embedded in cylindrical pendulum arm
- **Motor Sensor**: Mounted on Software I2C, reads motor shaft angle

### Calibration Achievements
- **Zero Position**: Successfully set with pendulum upright and arm centered
- **Physical Limits**: ±280 steps from center (560 total steps = 1008° range)
- **Step Tracking**: Working reliably using AccelStepper position counter
- **Manual Jogging**: Implemented direct digitalWrite pulse generation (bypasses AccelStepper for single steps)

### Issues Discovered & Resolved

#### Issue 1: AccelStepper Not Moving Motor
**Problem**: AccelStepper `run()` and `runToPosition()` methods weren't generating step pulses for single-step movements.

**Solution**: Created `manualStep()` function that directly pulses STEP pin:
```cpp
void manualStep(int direction) {
  digitalWrite(EN_PIN, LOW);
  digitalWrite(DIR_PIN, direction > 0 ? HIGH : LOW);
  digitalWrite(STEP_PIN, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(STEP_PIN, LOW);
  stepper.setCurrentPosition(stepper.currentPosition() + direction);
}
```

#### Issue 2: Severe Sensor Noise & Erratic Readings
**Problem**: Pendulum sensor showing massive jumps (±300°) even when stationary. Initial tests showed 20-60% error rate with readings jumping randomly.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Missing I2C Pull-up Resistors** (CRITICAL)
2. **Motor power supply noise** coupling into sensor readings
3. **Magnet distance** initially too close causing saturation

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. ✅ Added 5kΩ pull-up resistors (4 total):
   - Pin 20 (SDA) to 5V
   - Pin 21 (SCL) to 5V  
   - Pin 22 (SDA) to 5V
   - Pin 24 (SCL) to 5V

2. ✅ Adjusted magnet distance to ~2-3mm from AS5600 chip

**Results After Pull-ups**:
- **Motor power OFF**: 56 stable readings, only 2 large jumps (96% stable!)
- **Motor power ON**: Still noisy (0-4 stable readings, 21-32 jumps) due to power supply noise

### Diagnostic Tools Created
- **Live Sensor Test**: Real-time angle monitoring with delta tracking
- **EMI Test**: Motor driver disable test to isolate noise sources
- **I2C Bus Scanner**: Detects all devices on both I2C buses
- **Step-based Calibration**: Interactive jogging with A/D keys

### Code Architecture
**Main Script**: `main.cpp` - Step-based calibration system
- Menu-driven interface
- Manual jogging with immediate feedback
- Step-based limit recording
- Safety warnings and emergency stop (press 'S')

**Backup Scripts**:
- `main_step_calibration.cpp.bak` - Working calibration (current)
- `main_full_pid_control.cpp.bak` - Full PID balance control (pre-calibration)
- `main_angle_calibration.cpp.bak` - Failed angle-based approach (sensor wraparound issues)

### Tomorrow's Work (November 5, 2025)

#### Hardware Modifications Required

**Add Capacitors for Noise Reduction** (CRITICAL):

**Available Capacitors (from user's collection)**:
- 100µF / 50V electrolytic (polarized - RED/ORANGE)
- 10µF / 50V electrolytic (polarized - BLUE)
- 1µF / 63V electrolytic (polarized - RED/ORANGE)

**Detailed Installation Guide**: See `docs/CapacitorInstallationGuide.md` for complete beginner-friendly instructions with diagrams

1. **Motor Driver Power (TMC2209 VMOT)**:
   - 100µF electrolytic capacitor between VMOT and GND
   - Place as close as possible to driver
   - **Polarity**: + to VMOT, - to GND (stripe = negative)

2. **Arduino 5V Rail**:
   - 10µF electrolytic capacitor between 5V and GND
   - **Polarity**: + to 5V, - to GND (stripe = negative)

3. **Each AS5600 Sensor (2 total)**:
   - 1µF electrolytic capacitor between VCC and GND (at each sensor)
   - Place directly at sensor pins
   - **Polarity**: + to VCC, - to GND (stripe = negative)

**Expected Results**:
- Dramatically reduced sensor noise during motor operation
- Stable readings even with motor enabled
- Ready for closed-loop control implementation

#### Next Development Steps
1. Test sensors with capacitors installed
2. Verify <5% error rate during motor movement
3. Implement swing-up controller
4. Add PID balance control at upright position
